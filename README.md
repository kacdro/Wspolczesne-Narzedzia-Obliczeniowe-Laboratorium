# Wspolczesne-Narzedzia-Obliczeniowe-Laboratorium

This is the collection of the laboratories from the fifth semester of my studies. There contain a wide various of computer tasks. Below, I provide a brief description of these laboratories.

LAB 1

Cycloid Animation Script (Cykloid.py): This script animates a cycloid curve, generated by a point on the edge of a circle as it rolls along a straight line. The visualization captures the circle's rotation and the cycloid's progression, plotted as the circle "rolls" across the screen. This script serves as a practical tool for illustrating the dynamic creation of cycloids, which have applications in physics and engineering.

General Curve Animation Script (Curve.py): This script appears to animate a complex mathematical curve, possibly an epicycloid or another related type. It animates a general curve using an intricate function and demonstrates transformations such as rotation applied to a tracing point on a circle. The animation comprises the moving circle, the path being traced, and a line indicating the radius. It's a general-purpose tool that could be used to visualize a range of mathematical curves and their properties.

Hypocycloid Animation Script (Hipocykloida.py): This script generates a dynamic visualization of a hypocycloid, a curve produced by tracing a fixed point on a smaller circle as it rolls inside a larger circle. Customizable parameters allow users to set the radii of both circles. The animation features the motion of the rolling circle, the evolving path of the hypocycloid, and a line indicating the radius from the center of the inner circle to the tracing point. This visualization can be particularly educational in demonstrating the geometric properties of hypocycloids.

Epicycloid Animation Script (Epicykloida.py): This script is designed to create an animation of an epicycloid, a curve drawn by a point on the circumference of a smaller circle that rolls around a larger circle. The script allows adjustment of the radii of both circles and the offset of the tracing point from the smaller circle's center. The resulting animation displays the tracing point's movement, the path of the epicycloid, a vector showing the radius, and the smaller circle's tangent as it rolls around the larger circle, facilitating a visual understanding of epicycloids.

LAB 2

Convex Hull Visualization with Rotated Tigers

This Python script visualizes a convex hull of a set of random points using the Graham scan algorithm. Each point is represented with a rotated image of a tiger, and the convex hull is drawn to enclose the points.

Features
- Generation of a random set of points.
- Application of the Graham scan algorithm to identify the convex hull.
- Visualization of each point with a uniquely rotated tiger image.
- Plotting the convex hull with a closed loop around the points.

Requirements

- NumPy: For numerical computations and handling arrays.
- Matplotlib: For creating the plot and visualizing the convex hull.

Customization
You can adjust the following in the script to customize the visualization:

- Change num_points to vary the number of points.
- Modify the rotate_image function to handle different image rotation methods.
- Replace the tiger image with any image of your choice.

Visual Output

After running the script, you should see a plot titled 'Convex Hull around Randomly Generated Tigers' with each point having a unique tiger image rotated at a random angle. The points are connected by lines representing the convex hull.

LAB 3

Kirsch Edge Detection

The Kirsch edge detection script applies the Kirsch operator to an image for identifying edges in all eight possible orientations. This script is especially useful for highlighting the structural details in images by detecting sharp intensity changes.

Dependencies
OpenCV: For image processing tasks.
NumPy: For handling array operations.

How It Works

- The script loads the provided image in grayscale mode.
- It applies a median blur to reduce noise in the image.
- Eight Kirsch kernels are defined, corresponding to the eight possible edge orientations.
- Each kernel is convolved with the image to detect edges in a specific orientation.
- The absolute values of the gradients from each convolution are computed.
- The gradients are combined to form a single edge image.
- The combined edge image is normalized and converted to an 8-bit format.
- The resulting image is saved to a file named 'kirsch_edges.png'.

Output

The output is an image that highlights the edges detected by the Kirsch operator. This can be used to analyze the structure and features in the image.

Custom Canny Edge Detection

This script implements a custom version of the Canny edge detection algorithm using OpenCV and NumPy. It demonstrates how to manually apply Gaussian blur, compute gradient magnitudes and directions, perform non-maximum suppression, and finally, track edges by hysteresis.

Dependencies

OpenCV (cv2): For basic image processing functions.
NumPy: For efficient array operations.

How It Works

- Gaussian Blur: Initially, the input image is smoothed using a Gaussian filter to reduce noise and detail.
- Gradient Computation: The script computes the gradient magnitude and direction using custom convolution operations with Sobel kernels.
- Non-Maximum Suppression: It thins edges to 1-pixel wide lines by suppressing non-maximal gradient magnitudes across the gradient direction.
- Edge Tracking by Hysteresis: Finally, it defines strong and weak edges based on high and low threshold values and tracks edges by hysteresis to determine which edges are truly edge pixels.
