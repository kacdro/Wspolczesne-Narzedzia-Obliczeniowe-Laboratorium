# Wspolczesne-Narzedzia-Obliczeniowe-Laboratorium

This is the collection of the laboratories from the fifth semester of my studies. There contain a wide various of computer tasks. Below, I provide a brief description of these laboratories.

LAB 1

Cycloid Animation Script (Cykloid.py): This script animates a cycloid curve, generated by a point on the edge of a circle as it rolls along a straight line. The visualization captures the circle's rotation and the cycloid's progression, plotted as the circle "rolls" across the screen. This script serves as a practical tool for illustrating the dynamic creation of cycloids, which have applications in physics and engineering.

General Curve Animation Script (Curve.py): This script appears to animate a complex mathematical curve, possibly an epicycloid or another related type. It animates a general curve using an intricate function and demonstrates transformations such as rotation applied to a tracing point on a circle. The animation comprises the moving circle, the path being traced, and a line indicating the radius. It's a general-purpose tool that could be used to visualize a range of mathematical curves and their properties.

Hypocycloid Animation Script (Hipocykloida.py): This script generates a dynamic visualization of a hypocycloid, a curve produced by tracing a fixed point on a smaller circle as it rolls inside a larger circle. Customizable parameters allow users to set the radii of both circles. The animation features the motion of the rolling circle, the evolving path of the hypocycloid, and a line indicating the radius from the center of the inner circle to the tracing point. This visualization can be particularly educational in demonstrating the geometric properties of hypocycloids.

Epicycloid Animation Script (Epicykloida.py): This script is designed to create an animation of an epicycloid, a curve drawn by a point on the circumference of a smaller circle that rolls around a larger circle. The script allows adjustment of the radii of both circles and the offset of the tracing point from the smaller circle's center. The resulting animation displays the tracing point's movement, the path of the epicycloid, a vector showing the radius, and the smaller circle's tangent as it rolls around the larger circle, facilitating a visual understanding of epicycloids.
